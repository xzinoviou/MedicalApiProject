Medical Api  - Rest

This project was implemented to familiarize with the Rest Architecture.
Java was selected for Back-End, which exposes specific end points and the UI (AngularJS) consumes the resources.
The purpose of the Api is to be secured with basic authentication over an SSL tunnel. If a user is not authenticated (which is done when logged in)
then the end points are exposing any info.
Modifications to be made in future  project for implementing JWT auth solution.
